In this exercise, we will simply examine how the METIS API is used.

    Step 1: Build the METIS Library
	./build-metis.sh

    Step 2: Go to either the demo directories
	cd demo.1.box
	cd demo.2.box

    Step 3: Build the demo program
	make

    Step 4: Run the program
	./MetisDemo

    Step 5: Visualize the VTK output
	Use VisIt to open the *.vtk files.
	Look at the mesh and the Partition_ID variable.
